                What is Churn Risk Scoring?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Churn risk scoring is a proactive approach to identify which
                customers are most likely to <strong>churn</strong>, or stop using
                your service. Instead of waiting for customers to leave, this
                model uses key behavioral and demographic data to assign a risk
                score. This allows you to intervene with targeted retention
                strategies before it&apos;s too late. It&apos;s a fundamental tool for
                any business serious about reducing its customer{' '}
                <strong>churn</strong> rate.

              <p>
                This calculator provides a simplified model for assessing{' '}
                <strong>churn</strong> risk. Input the following data points for an
                individual customer:
              </p>
              <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mt-2">
                <li>
                  <strong>Customer Tenure (Months):</strong> How long has the
                  customer been with you? Newer customers often have a higher{' '}
                  <strong>churn</strong> risk.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Usage Frequency:</strong> How often do they engage with
                  your product? A drop in usage is a classic leading indicator
                  of <strong>churn</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Satisfaction Score (1-5):</strong> What was their
                  rating in the last satisfaction survey? Low scores are a
                  direct signal of dissatisfaction that can lead to{' '}
                  <strong>churn</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Support Tickets:</strong> How many support tickets have
                  they filed recently? A high number can indicate either
                  frustration with the product or high engagement.
                </li>
              </ol>
